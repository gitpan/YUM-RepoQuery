NAME
    YUM::RepoQuery - Query a YUM repository for package information

VERSION
    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
        use YUM::RepoQuery;

        my $repo = YUM::RepoQuery->new(
            # short tag to id the repo with
            id  => 'f9-updates-src'
            # uri to the repository
            uri => 'ftp://mirrors.kernel.org/fedora/updates/9/SRPMS',
        );

DESCRIPTION
    YUM::RepoQuery takes the URI to a package repository with YUM metadata,
    and allows one to query what packages, and versions of those packages,
    are available in that repo.

    WARNING: This is a very early, primitive package. "Release early,
    release often", right? :)

INTERFACE
    "Release Early, Release Often"

    There's a bunch more that we can do here (not the least of which is
    documentation!). As I get time, I'll be updating and adding more; please
    feel free to drop a line with patches / requests either at my email or
    (preferably) at this module's rt tracker address
    (bug-yum-repoquery@rt.cpan.org).

  METHODS
    new()
        Standard constructor. Takes a number of arguments, two of which are
        required:

        *id*
            (Required) The id one refers to this repo as. Used mainly in
            looking for existing yum cache directories under /var/tmp/.

        *uri*
            (Required) The URI of the repository.

    primary
        The DBIx::Class schema corresponding to this repository's
        primary.sqlite.

    other
        The DBIx::Class schema corresponding to this repository's
        other.sqlite.

    filelists
        The DBIx::Class schema corresponding to this repository's
        filelists.sqlite.

    packages
        An array of all packages in this repo.

    package_count
        Returns the count of all packages in this repository.

    has_package (str)
        When called with a package name, returns true if that package exists
        in this repository.

    get_package (str)
        Given a package name, returns the row object corresponding to it.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    No bugs have been reported.

    There's a lot of room for improvement here; a better set of accessors +
    tests would certainly be nice.

    Please report any bugs or feature requests to
    "bug-yum-repoquery@rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at
    <http://rt.cpan.org>.
